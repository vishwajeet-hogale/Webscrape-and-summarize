Few fortunes are as volatile as Masayoshi Son’s or Masa. The SoftBank Group Corp. founder was briefly richer than Bill Gates at the start of the century before tech stocks crashed. In March 2020, as markets sank under covid-19 and questions swirled over SoftBank’s investments, his wealth dipped to $8.4 billion, the lowest since 2016.   Less than a year later, Japan’s second-richest person has more than quadrupled his fortune to $38 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, hitting the highest level since Bloomberg started tracking billionaire wealth in 2012.

SoftBank’s stock price has surpassed its dot-com peak, thanks in part to aggressive share buybacks and the successful initial public offerings of its unicorns, such as food delivery startup DoorDash Inc. The Vision Fund—the world’s largest investment pool for tech startups—posted its best quarterly profit, while SoftBank sold assets, bought back stock and settled a legal dispute with WeWork Cos. It’s also gathered supporters along the way, with Paul Singer’s Elliott Management Corp. disclosing last year it took a stake as the stock was undervalued. “SoftBank’s current major assets have huge cash flow and will continue to grow,"" said Thomas Hayes, chairman of Great Hill Capital. “If he balances his harvesting of winners, with appropriately timed share repurchases, he will avoid a repeat of 2000, even if tech stocks moderate."" That said, founder Masa’s star power is somewhat waning. SoftBank managed to raise only $600 million last year in the US special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) boom. Its third blank check outing has a goal of only $280 million. In comparison, Chamath Palihapitiya, a former Facebook Inc executive, venture capitalist, and social influencer, raised $2.1 billion in one October day alone. He’s the new superstar on the block.

Masa’s eclipse is probably due to SoftBank’s troubled past—which isn’t that much in the past. Still vivid are WeWork’s IPO debacle in 2019, and the messy entanglement with WireCard AG last year. SoftBank is now considering a complete write-down of its $1.5-billion stake in Greensill Capital, which was using reverse factoring to disrupt the sleepy supply-chain finance sector.

The man and his plans SoftBank’s fate has been deeply intertwined with its founder, to the point the relationship recently raised corporate-governance concerns. Masa, who’s also chairman and chief executive officer, is personally invested in a unit that poured about $20 billion into tech stocks and derivatives. The 63-year-old, who owns one-third of that division and has denied there was a conflict of interest, said the program was a way to put SoftBank’s cash pile to use. To amplify his leverage, Masa uses a common tactic among the ultra-rich— borrowing against his stock. He just does it much more than most other billionaires. Recently, though, he’s trimmed his pledges as shares of the Japanese giant have become more valuable. Masa had committed about one-third of his stake in SoftBank to more than 16 financial institutions as of February 9, down from 38% in September, according to regulatory filings. That still represents about $18 billion—one of the highest figures among the 500 richest people in the world. The pledges are used as collateral for loans, whose size could be smaller than the value of the committed shares given the recent rally (Bloomberg doesn’t include the value of pledged stock in net-worth calculations). A representative for SoftBank declined to comment for this story. After closing at an all-time high on Wednesday, SoftBank shares slipped 5.3% Thursday amid a decline in the broader stock market. Its Vision Fund last month posted a record profit for the final quarter of 2020, thanks to a boost in the value of its stakes in newly-listed firms including DoorDash Inc and Chinese online property agent platform KE Holdings Inc. “Since the Vision Fund launched, the number of golden eggs is in accelerating mode,"" Masa said at a briefing last month. “We are finally in the harvesting stage."" Some 15 companies have gone public from the Vision Fund, and SoftBank may see between 10 and 20 listings a year from its portfolio of 164 startups, he said. Coupang Inc, a South Korean e-commerce giant, is seeking a US IPO and could be valued at more than $50 billion. Compass Inc., one of the largest US real estate brokerages, has filed for a listing, and Chinese truck startup Full Truck Alliance could go public this year. SoftBank has also had its share of troubles. As mentioned earlier, the Vision Fund has written down its $1.5 billion holding in Greensill Capital and is considering dropping the valuation to near zero, people familiar with the matter have said. At its worst point last year, investors questioned several of SoftBank’s investments, including WeWork, whose IPO spectacularly imploded. That said, the turnaround has been rapid. In addition to improving the outlook for the startups in the Vision Fund, the rally in tech stocks helped boost the value of SoftBank’s stakes in publicly traded firms like Uber Technologies Inc. The Japanese conglomerate also just settled a lawsuit with WeWork and its co-founder, Adam Neumann, paving the way for another attempt at a potential listing of the office-sharing company. “SoftBank Group may expedite its second attempt to list WeWork,"" Anthea Lai, a senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote in a 1 March note. “The additional stake should tighten SoftBank’s control and facilitate potential merger talks with special purpose acquisition companies."" The big bet on Coupang The Vision Fund is preparing one of the unicorns it’s long nurtured in its stables for an IPO: the South Korean e-commerce giant Coupang, whose operations span online groceries and restaurant deliveries all the way to video streaming. Coupang is seeking to raise up to $3.6 billion in New York. That has a whiff of Son’s old recipe for success, which was embodied in WeWork. When the shared workspace company came to market in 2019, investors worried about its massive debt pile, including $47 billion in lease obligations. It was an extreme example of what Masa loved—debt-fuelled mega-unicorns that seemed to grow despite the odds. Like WeWork, Coupang—which was founded a decade ago—seems forever hungry for cash. In 2020, its revenue jumped 91% year-on-year to $12 billion, but its operating costs rose 81% as well. Meanwhile, its working capital flipped into a deficit of $892 million from $273 million in surplus a year earlier. Because of its cash burn, Coupang had negative equity as of 2020 year-end, despite $2 billion in investments from the $100 billion Vision Fund, agreed upon in December 2018. The South Korean company sat on $5.7 billion in debt; roughly half of which, or $2.9 billion, was in the form of accounts payable to its suppliers. It’s no surprise then, that Coupang is keen to go public. The question remains for investors: Where’s the operating leverage of this 10-year-old, or its economies of scale? Profitability appears out of reach. Granted, as long as Coupang can list, it’s a win for Masa. Over the years, SoftBank has put $3 billion into the Korean company and, after the IPO, will hold a 37% stake via the Vision Fund. At the midpoint of the offering range, that would be worth $18 billion. The Vision Fund is not selling when Coupang debuts in New York, but it can record a sweet paper gain. All well and good. But Coupang reminds us how many aging unicorns SoftBank still has hanging around in its Vision Fund. What makes Coupang stand out exactly other than cash burn? On the other hand, Palihapitiya seems to be involved with cutting edge enterprises. He merged his first SPAC with Richard Branson’s space tourism business Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. His second SPAC was with real estate tech start-up Opendoor Technologies Inc, which was first backed by Masa in 2018. It was Palihapitiya, however, who got it listed. In conclusion Take a look at Vision Fund’s portfolio. Since its inception in 2017, only 11 startups in its portfolio have gone public; 74, including Indonesian e-commerce company Tokopedia PT, which has only reached a series I funding round, are still privately-held. As of December 2020, the Vision Fund notched $18 billion in capital gain from a year ago. But can these wins be turned into cash profits? The fund expects $10.1 billion in gross realized proceeds from its sales of ARM Holdings Inc. to Nvidia Corp. That deal has not closed yet. SoftBank’s attempt to ride the SPAC boom comes across as flawed. In its revised prospectus for the third blank check company, SoftBank removed the warrant that allows its holders to buy more shares at a 15% premium to the $10 issue price. That may explain why SoftBank is cutting its offering goal. SPACs are well-liked by hedge funds and retail investors, with the former seeing it as a fixed income product with a ton of upside—thanks to the warrant—while the latter uses it as a “poor man’s"" private equity fund. As the offering currently stands, Masa is not giving hedge funds the upside they crave and is keeping it all to himself. Chamath, on the other hand, is fully into playing the game: promoting via tweet his involvement in a so-called private investing in public equity (PIPE) funding round to help his SPACs merge with targets. A blank-check company is a shell company that raises money from public investors with the goal of acquiring a business within two years. These deals—some sponsored by the rich and famous including Hong Kong billionaire Richard Li and ex-Credit Suisse chief Tidjane Thiam—have raised more than $66 billion in the US alone just this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Singapore could join the bandwagon soon. The country’s exchange is consulting the market on allowing SPACs to go public and could see its first such listing this year if it gets enough support. As many as 10 Indian companies could go public through SPAC deals before the end of the year and the trend could accelerate if Singapore’s blank-check firm listings are permitted, Utpal Oza, head of investment banking for India at Nomura, said. So, sure, SoftBank’s stock price has returned to its dot-com peak. But is that really something worth celebrating? So did the Nasdaq—and the benchmark index has rallied well beyond its old heights. The world has moved on. Masa is beginning to sound like a name from the past. Once upon a time, he ran the world’s biggest venture capital fund.

Mytrah Energy India Pvt. Ltd is exploring a merger with other green energy firms in India to create a bigger entity ahead of a US listing plan through the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) route option, said two people aware of the development.   The plan, which is in a preliminary stage, is to combine green energy firms, including Mytrah Energy, having less than 5 gigawatts (GW) portfolio, said the people cited above requesting anonymity.

Vikram Kailas, co-founder and MD of Mytrah Energy, declined to comment. SPACs are publicly traded shell companies that merge with unlisted companies to take them public, skipping the time-consuming conventional route of initial public offering (IPO). Indian green energy firms are exploring this option amid a growing focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing. Goldman Sachs-backed ReNew Power, one of India’s top green energy developers, successfully used the SPAC route by announcing its merger agreement with Nasdaq-listed SPAC RMG Acquisition Corp. II last week at an enterprise value of about $8 billion and an equity value of $4.4 billion. Mytrah Energy is exploring the use of the SPAC route for a listing after its $750-million equity deal with private equity firm KKR fell through.

This comprises 1.7GW of wind and around 535MW of solar, besides another 700MW of projects under development. Mint reported earlier about Mytrah reviving its stake sale process and looking to appoint Barclays Bank to sell a majority stake. In 2010, Mytrah listed on the alternative investment market of the London Stock Exchange after raising $80 million from institutional investors. It delisted in May 2018. The company was earlier also considering a public listing in India. A spokesperson for Barclays Bank India declined to comment. Like Mytrah, ReNew Power also shelved in 2019 plans for an IPO in India amid market volatility. The company may later explore a listing in India, as reported by Mint earlier. “Indian renewable energy firms are exploring the SPAC option, given that the Indian IPO plans didn’t materialize and US listings are offering higher valuations. While earlier, there was an appetite for tech firms to be listed through the SPAC route, that appetite is now growing for infrastructure firms,"" said one of the two people cited above. Mytrah Energy’s plans come at a time of rising demand for electricity in India, which touched a high of 189.6GW in December. India is running the world’s largest green energy programme and has been rapidly expanding its clean energy capacity at low tariffs. India has set a target of achieving a 450GW renewable energy capacity by 2030. It currently has an installed renewable energy capacity of 89.63GW, with around 49.59GW capacity under execution and another 27.41GW been tendered.

Bengaluru: Early-stage investor Blume Ventures, which has invested in Dunzo, Instamojo among others, believes 10-12 of its portfolio firms can potentially go public or turn unicorns over the next decade, as startups are taking first steps towards initial public offerings (IPOs), said a top executive.   The decade-old firm which is nearing the end of the deployment cycle of Fund III, closed in 2018, has looked at various ways to stay invested in its growing portfolio.

This secondary sale or transfer of stake, at current valuations, allowed Blume to give exits to its limited partners (LPs) in Fund I, that was launched in 2011. Fund 1X can invest further in these six firms during future fund-raises, allowing LPs through Blume to increase their stake in these startups. The companies which are now a part of Fund 1X include automation warehousing startup GreyOrange; beauty marketplace Purplle; insurtech firm Turtlemint and B2B startups Exotel, IDfy and WebEngage. According to Blume, secondary structures are common as fund lives reach their natural limits. Historically, buyers in such funds have been offshore institutional investors, who specialize in taking risk of this nature. However, the challenges of a covid-year allowed for innovation onshore. Ashish Fafadia, partner, Blume Ventures told Mint the new fund was also aimed at remaining invested in portfolio startups while being relevant to their needs at growth stage. “With Fund I maturing, we were not keen to sell off our stakes in the portfolio and yet be able to deliver respectable exit outcomes within the fund life. Among the reasons were - that we would have to wait for follow-ons, with July last year not being a conducive time for fund raising. We felt the performance of the companies was good with an IPO potential, showing a strong path to profitability. Hence, instead of quick stake sales, we began figuring out new partnership opportunities,"" said Fafadia.

Through Fund 1X, Blume also claims to have allowed Fund 1 and Fund 1A investors to see gross cash returns more than double, while they can still expect an additional 1-2x from the residual positions that were not a part of this secondary portfolio. “Blume is making focused investments with deeper conviction, and wants to deliver the same value to founders, while being relevant right from early to different growth stages, until the exit. We have been vested in the portfolio and now want to be catalysts to create more unicorns, and deliver 5x plus returns to our LPs, in the process,"" said Fafadia.

It continues to be bullish about early stage, making 8-10 investments annually across health, fintech, logistics and SaaS among others.

India’s private life insurance firms have managed to weather the pandemic, making good the loss of business during the lockdown. The largest life insurer, SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd, too, has shown a sharp recovery and investors have taken note of this. Business growth is crucial for life insurers because it is the bedrock of future profits.   The company’s management is optimistic that it would end the year on a growth note despite the massive hit on business in the April-June quarter. Analysts have pegged the FY21 business growth to be around 5% on an annualized premium equivalent basis. With much of the year already gone by, the focus now has rightly shifted to the next financial year. The question now is whether SBI Life will not just sustain but also show a significant boost in growth for FY22.

The last parameter is a strength that analysts have often highlighted. However, the access to SBI’s network has always been there and SBI Life has been able to use less than 2% of SBI’s customer pool, said analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd. This untapped potential and the tie-ups with other public sector banks augur well for growth prospects in the coming years. Given that proprietary channels were hit during the lockdown, the life insurer has seen a sharp rise in its digital sales. This is a good sign for growth. That said, bancassurance channel contributes the lion’s share in premiums. SBI accounted for 60% of the premiums in the nine months ended December.

The value of new business grew 13%, not a mean feat during a pandemic. Covid has made Indians more willing to buy life insurance and that seems to have worked in favour of life insurance companies. However, SBI Life’s shares have not made big gains so far this year compared to peers and its growth numbers did not excite investors. There is one other aspect that investors need to focus on. Life Insurance Corp. of India (LIC), the largest player in the country, may get listed in FY22. The government has reiterated its intention to list LIC through an initial public offering. Of course, this is a threat to all listed private life insurers. However, SBI Life could be hit harder than others because there is overlap between its target client base and that of LIC. “We will watch for any impact of aggressive sales push by LIC, which may have higher overlap with the targeted segments and markets of SBI Life,"" wrote analysts at Jefferies in a note. In FY22, SBI Life must not only deliver high growth but also guard against the insurance behemoth in market share.

6,"UK opens door to SPACs, big tech IPOs to compete with New York",https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/uk-opens-door-to-spacs-big-tech-ipos-to-compete-with-new-york-11614771063557.html,"2 min read . Updated: 03 Mar 2021, 05:06 PM IST ","  
The U.K. government signaled support for looser stock-listing rules to attract tech companies and SPACs, moves aimed at helping London compete with New York and retain its position as Europe’s pre-eminent financial center post-Brexit.   The proposals, expected to be formally announced Wednesday, would make it easier for company founders to list shares without giving up control and still make the stock eligible for inclusion in the London Stock Exchange’s blue-chip FTSE indexes.

The proposals “are about closing a gap"" between London and other global centers, said former U.K. politician Jonathan Hill, who spearheaded a government-ordered review of the listing rules. London faces challenges to its status following the U.K.’s official departure from the European Union. Big chunks of London stock-trading volumes quickly moved to venues in Amsterdam and Paris when post-Brexit rules took effect Jan 1. U.K. Treasury chief Rishi Sunak said he would move quickly on the recommendations. The U.K. government is betting on a thriving IPO market to create jobs for bankers, money managers and other professionals in support of the country’s financial-services sector. The listing rule changes, which require approval from the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority, would also aim to diversify London’s recently underperforming stock market, which is tilted toward old-line companies in areas such as banking, energy and mining. To attract more tech names to London, Mr. Hill’s report recommends dropping the maximum number of shares that companies need to sell in an IPO for a “premium listing"" needed for index inclusion to 15% from 25%. Similarly, founders should be allowed to sell dual-class shares in an IPO to retain greater voting rights than public investors.

Today Facebook and Alphabet are among the largest members of the S&P 500 benchmark and serve as magnets for new growth companies to list in the U.S. Last month, South Korea’s Coupang Inc. announced plans for a U.S. IPO in a deal that is expected to generate a valuation exceeding $50 billion. Hong Kong introduced dual-class shares in 2018, sparking a series of high-profile tech listings, including China’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. the next year. Clare Reilly, an executive from pension provider PensionBee Ltd., warned that the move could erode investor protections. “One share, one vote is the foundation of strong corporate governance, and we see that as a principle that’s under threat all around the world,"" she said. Regarding SPACs, the proposed changes could let investors opt out of deals if they don’t like the acquisition the SPAC managers choose and would let them trade shares immediately after a deal’s announcement, bringing London in line with the U.S. market. London’s tighter listing requirements have left it behind when it comes to SPACs. Some European companies, including U.K. betting data firm Genius Sports Group Ltd., and Arrival Ltd., a London-based electric-vehicle manufacturer, both announced plans in recent months to list through New York-listed SPACs. SPACs appeal to tech startups over traditional IPOs because the process is faster and allows companies to provide revenue and profit forecasts to attract investor interest.

Policybazaar may allocate up to 60% of the portion available for allocation to qualified institutional buyers to anchor investors a day before the IPO opening. In an IPO, at least two and a maximum of 15 anchor investors are allowed to be allocated up to  ₹250 crore worth of shares. On 15 February, Mint reported that Policybazaar is launching a  ₹4,000 crore IPO at a valuation of at least $3.5 billion Bay Capital has completed a secondary transaction, ahead of the insurance aggregator’s plans to launch an IPO. ""With its extremely long term horizon, Bay Capital has built an impressive portfolio of franchises straddling along the growth opportunities in India in areas such as consumer, digital, finance, outsourcing and health,"" said Bay Capital. ""The company’s tech focused approach has been a key enabler in ensuring better transparency, decreasing costs, and increasing adoption in the country over the last 12 years. We believe PB Fintech is well-positioned to become one of the largest financial services e-commerce company in India and is poised for a strong growth trajectory in the years to come,"" added Mehta.
